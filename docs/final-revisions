Cursor + LLM troubleshooting:
Implement streaming functionality on chat
add loading animation when a quick action icon is selected from the actionbot, regardless of model used. 




Lovable changes
projects selector from the top must firt navigate to projet list view, and if no project exists, then show the add project view.
Adjust default theme, 
implement light theme (see actionit whatsapp chat for theme description)

figure out the bare minimum settings you want users to adjust. 
remove the / feature in the notebooks/blocks, using slash cancels out text input

for sync ups, have it show the latest syncups, rather than todays syncups 


## Troubleshoot data population issues. data tends to load on the first section I navigate to but it does not load all data from all the other tabs/sections (set application to load all data from all sections from initial page load, ensuring all data is populated for actionbot, notebooks, and projects)


notebook section has to be optimized for mobile view


the icons on recent tasks on the command view, need to either have chat linking and notelinking working, then be used to navigate to the corresponding linked note/actionbot, or removed entirely
